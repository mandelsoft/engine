// Package graph provides formal graph versions for a graph of
// generated expressions based of the operator/value metamodel.
//
// It provides wrappers for generated db objects, which provide
// sub version node sets according to their spec, which can be
// combined to a grap object, which finally provides
// formal graph version.
// Those version must be reached after a successful processing
// of the given nodes by the engine.
